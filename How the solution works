BST Sequences: A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. 
Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.

Solution.

Let's start with an example of the base case:
the tree:

     4

As we can see there is only 1 way to create this tree(with a single node), so the solution is
[4]

let's move on to little more complex situation

    4
   / \
  2   5 

Here we can see that we have to insert the node with the number 4 first. 
This node is always going to be the first element in each of the possible solution.
So to create the list we have to start with 4, and then the rest of the possibilities.
what possibilities do we have?
let's look:

   / \
  2   5 

we can choose 2 or 5 in any order

so the solution is 
[[4,2,5],[4,5,2]]


Now there is another situation that exists and needed to deal with, suppose we have the next tree:

    4
   / \
  2   5 
       \
        6

how we can build it?
well we have to start with 4 so let's delete this

  2   5 
       \
        6
what ways can we build this tree:
Well we can start the left and then move to the right so: [[4,2,5,6]]
Well we can start the right and then move to left so: [[4,5,6,2]]
But we can also mix it up a bit... we can start with 5, move to 2 and return for 6 and get [[4,5,2,6]]
this is a problem that we also have take into account.
the problem is the fact that sometimes we can mix the ways we build the right and left parts of the tree.
but the build will always for them, meaning that 5 will always come before 6. 


So now, we start understand the way to solve this
- On a given Node, create a list that contains only this Node as a possible solution call "selfSolution"(in a case the he have no Children)
- Get all the solutions from the right part of the tree. let's call them "rightSolutions"
(Which is a list of lists of ways to build the right part of the tree)
- Get all the solutions from the left part of the tree. let's call them "leftSolutions" 
(Which is a list of lists of ways to build the left part of the tree)
- create a new list of lists, let's call it "lists".
- Combine the self,right and left solutions to create the "lists" which contains all the ways to build this tree, how to Combine?
In the following way:
- Create newlistRightLeft that the combine of selfSolution, one of the rightSolutions and then one of the leftSolutions 
for every rightSolutions and leftSolutions.
- add newlistRightLeft to "lists"
- Create newlistLeftRight that the combine of selfSolution, one of the leftSolutions and then one of the rightSolutions 
for every leftSolutions and rightSolutions.
- add newlistLeftRight to "lists"
- Create newlistMixRightLeft that is the combine of selfSolution, one of the rightSolutions and then one of the leftSolutions  
for every rightSolutions and leftSolutions when they are mix together.
-add newlistMixRightLeft to "lists"
- Create newlistMixLeftRight that is the combine of selfSolution, one of the leftSolutions and then one of the rightSolutions  
for every leftSolutions and rightSolutions when they are mix together.
- add newlistMixLeftRight to "lists" 

Now we create for a given node all the ways to build the tree with him on it, so we can return "lists" as all the way to build this 
tree.
